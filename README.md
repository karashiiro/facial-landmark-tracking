# facial-landmark-tracking
Very WIP face and eye tracking using OpenCV and dlib.

Pick up the model from [this repository](https://github.com/karashiiro/facial-landmark-tracking-models) and put it in the same directory as the other code files,
install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run `python demo.py` to view the current state of the project.
